# Testing Input Fields

I've done this school project at Codecool's tester course.

## Story

In this project, we've designed and written test cases for [SeleniumEasy website](https://www.seleniumeasy.com/test/basic-first-form-demo.html) that has different input fields with various features.

#### **List of sections to test:**

- Input Forms / Simple Form Demo / Two Input Fields
- Input Forms / Radio Buttons Demo
- Input Forms / Select Dropdown List
- Input Forms / Date pickers / Bootstrap Date Picker
